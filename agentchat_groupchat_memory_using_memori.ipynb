    "# Multi-agent Conversation and Recall using Memori\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll learn how to create AI agents that can **remember** conversations and use that memory in future discussions. We'll build a simple consulting team that gets smarter over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What you'll learn:\n",
    "- How to set up AI agents that work together\n",
    "- How to give agents persistent memory\n",
    "- How memory makes conversations better and more helpful\n",
    "\n",
    "## The scenario:\n",
    "We'll create a **Software Development Consulting Team** with two AI agents:\n",
    "- **Alex** - Technical Architect (designs systems)\n",
    "- **Sam** - Full-Stack Developer (builds applications)\n",
    "\n",
    "They'll help a client build an e-commerce website, and they'll remember everything discussed!"

    "## What is Memori?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Memori** is an open-source memory engine that provides persistent, intelligent memory for any LLM using standard SQL databases. Memori uses multiple agents working together to intelligently promote essential long-term memories to short-term storage for faster context injection.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a single line of code `memori.enable()` any LLM gains the ability to remember conversations, learn from interactions, and maintain context across sessions. The entire memory system is stored in a standard SQLite database (or PostgreSQL/MySQL for enterprise deployments), making it fully portable, auditable, and owned by the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key features:\n",
    "- **Auto-recording**: Automatically saves all conversations\n",
    "- **Works with existing databases**: SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB\n",
    "- **Smart memory**: AI decides what's important to remember\n",
    "- **Cross-session**: Agents remember between different conversations\n",
    "- **Zero setup**: Just initialize and enable - that's it!"

    "\n",
    "### What you accomplished:\n",
    "✅ Created AI agents that work together as a team  \n",
    "✅ Gave them persistent memory using Memori  \n",
    "✅ Ran multiple conversations that build on each other  \n",
    "✅ Saw how memory makes conversations more helpful  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Key insights from this demo:\n",
    "1. **Memory makes agents smarter**: They remembered budget ($50K), team skills (React/Python), and project constraints\n",
    "2. **Conversations build naturally**: Each discussion referenced previous context\n",
    "3. **Zero manual work**: Memori automatically captured and used relevant information\n",
    "4. **Persistent across sessions**: Restart the notebook and the agents will still remember!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-world applications:\n",
    "- **Customer Support**: Remember customer history and preferences\n",
    "- **Project Management**: Track decisions, requirements, and progress\n",
    "- **Personal Assistant**: Remember your preferences and past conversations\n",
    "- **Educational Tutoring**: Track student progress and learning style\n",
    "- **Medical Consultation**: Remember patient history and treatment plans"
